&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro--history-of-rowhammer&#34;&gt;Intro &amp;amp; History of RowHammer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-rowhammer&#34;&gt;What is RowHammer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RowHammer is the name of a &lt;strong&gt;very critical vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt; found in DRAM.
The concept relies on repetitively accessing the same location in memory.
As DRAM chips tend to hold more memory, manufacturers create chips with
smaller and closer cells. The proximity of these cells in the DRAM introduces
electromagnetic coupling effects between them, causing them to interact with
each other in undesirable ways. This operation may induce &lt;strong&gt;bit flips&lt;/strong&gt; in
adjacents locations. Yoongu Kim et al. paper was published in 2014, and it
is the first time the RowHammer problem was mentioned. At this point, the
team demonstrated that most of the DRAM modules existing on the market were
affected by this vulnerability. They also discussed different solutions
to these disturbances. Some of the solutions are hardware fixes, and others
are software approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-zero-project&#34;&gt;Google Zero Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper of Kim et al. has been a reference for the
team of the Google Zero project. They found a working privilege escalation
exploit that use rowhammer-induced bit flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64
Linux when run as an unprivileged userland process.  The process induced bit
flips in &lt;strong&gt;page table entries&lt;/strong&gt; (PTEs). It is an entry in the Page Table that
stores in 4 Bytes information about a page of memory. Each PTE contains
information such as the physical address of the page in memory, if the page is
present in memory or not if it is writable or not, and also &lt;strong&gt;access
permissions&lt;/strong&gt;. Google Zero&amp;rsquo;s team induced bit flips in a PTE to obtain write
access to its own page table and then gain read-write access to all of the
physical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causing bit flips in PTEs is just a possibility of exploitation; other ways of
exploiting bit flips can be practical too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make such a routine work, google zero specified that there are plenty of
methods for the &lt;strong&gt;address selection&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the &lt;strong&gt;CPU cache&lt;/strong&gt; must be
flushed at each access to make sure data is written out to actual memory and not
read from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vuldbs-article&#34;&gt;VULDB&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RowHammer exposes a security threat since it leads to a
breach of memory isolation, where accesses to one row (a user-level memory page)
modify the data stored in another memory row. This vulnerability has been
handled as &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuldb.com/?id.73928&#34;&gt;CVE-2015-0565&lt;/a&gt; since 01/06/2015 on the
vuldb website. It has a CVSS Meta Temp Score of 8.7. The Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) is a method used to supply a qualitative measure of
severity. CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and
Environmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A score between 7.0 and 8.9 corresponds to a high-risk vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the exploitation is known to be difficult and is at a state of proof of
concept, the interests of the attackers are quite low through. The website also
mentions that all devices using DRAM and some servers rack are affected by
RowHammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dram-structure--usage&#34;&gt;DRAM Structure &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cells-rows-banks-and-ranks&#34;&gt;Cells, rows, banks, and ranks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, DRAM has cells and rows. Cells are a &lt;strong&gt;capacitor&lt;/strong&gt; and a
transistor, also called &lt;strong&gt;access transistor&lt;/strong&gt;. If the capacitor is charged, the
cell will be in a charged state. At the other end, if the capacitor&amp;rsquo;s voltage it
will be in a discharged state. A charged state doesn&amp;rsquo;t always represent a bit
value of 1, and a discharged state doesn&amp;rsquo;t always represent a bit value of 0.
Their value will depend on the &lt;strong&gt;orientation&lt;/strong&gt; of the cell, and it will be
chosen by the manufacturer of the DRAM module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DRAM modules, we find arrays of cells like this. The rows of this array are
called &lt;strong&gt;wordline&lt;/strong&gt;, and the columns are &lt;strong&gt;bitline&lt;/strong&gt;. When the charge of a row
is raised to a high voltage, each access transistor of the line is enabled, and
it allows the charge in the capacitors to be transferred to a buffer called
&lt;strong&gt;rowbuffer&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, the content is copied back to the cells by recharging them.
When the charge of the line is lowered to zero, the capacitors are disconnected
from the rowbuffer, and it is ready to store a new wordline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These arrays of rows are grouped in sets and referenced as &lt;strong&gt;banks&lt;/strong&gt;, and there
is a rowbuffer for each bank. Finally, multiple banks come together to form a
&lt;strong&gt;rank&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important to note that the same bank location is accessed
simultaneously across all the DRAM chips within a rank. In a way, organizing the
DRAM chips into ranks gives the Memory Controller the illusion that it can
interact with a high-capacity single DRAM chip. For example, consider a rank of
4 DRAM chips: 64 bytes of data need to be read from a location in Bank 2. In
this case, each DRAM chip will contribute 16 bytes of data from their respective
banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discharging and recharging&lt;/strong&gt; the cells repeatedly can induce disturbances on
adjacents rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refreshing-dram&#34;&gt;Refreshing DRAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As detailed earlier, cells are made of a capacitor and a transistor. The
capacitor holds a charge that represents a state. Because of some leakage
mechanisms, they &lt;strong&gt;discharge&lt;/strong&gt; themselves through time. If the
capacitor&amp;rsquo;s charge becomes too low, its state changes, and data can be lost. The
amount of time that a cell can hold a charge is called &lt;strong&gt;retention time&lt;/strong&gt;, and
it is usually 64ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent data loss, the memory controller will periodically read each row to
restore the original charge of the capacitor. This process, although it&amp;rsquo;s the
same as reading a row, is called &lt;strong&gt;refreshing&lt;/strong&gt; and prevents capacitors from
leaking too much. As the retention time is 64ms, the memory controller will
refresh a cell at least once during this amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to trigger bit flips, the hammering must be done in enough amount of
time between each refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accessing-dram&#34;&gt;Accessing DRAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snippet of code has been released in Yoongu Kim&amp;rsquo;s paper :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-asm&#34; data-lang=&#34;asm&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    code1a:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;), %eax  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Read from address X
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;), %ebx  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Read from address Y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;clflush&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;)  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Flush cache for address X
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;clflush&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;)  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Flush cache for address Y jmp code1a
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mov instructions read from DRAM at addresses X and Y and load the data into
a register and also the CPU&amp;rsquo;s cache. Then the two clflush instructions empty the
processor&amp;rsquo;s cache. Finally, the code jumps back to the first instruction for
another iteration of reading from DRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code1a can cause bitflips if the addresses X and Y are well chosen: they
must be in the same bank but must not be in the same row. Supposing X and Y
point to the same location, this snippet of code will read the data only from
the row buffer and not trigger the process of charging and discharging the cell.
If the X and Y are in two different rows, code1a will cause these rows to be
repeatedly activated. This routine is called &lt;strong&gt;row hammering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pick the rights addresses, Google Zero&amp;rsquo;s team explored several techniques.
The first one is also the one mentioned in Yoongu Kim&amp;rsquo;s paper: they use their
knowledge about &lt;strong&gt;physical address mapping&lt;/strong&gt;. It is possible to use absolute
physical addresses, which are available in &lt;em&gt;/proc/PID/pagemap&lt;/em&gt; in Linux. Yoongu
Kim et al. chose to pick Y = X + 8Mb. This delta was found in reversing Intel
and AMD&amp;rsquo;s CPU memory controller. Moreover, the concept of huge pages can be
useful: in most of the DRAM modules available on the market, rowbuffers sizes
are mostly 8192 bytes wide, so classical pages aren&amp;rsquo;t big enough.  Another one
relies on &lt;strong&gt;random address selection&lt;/strong&gt;: we simply have to allocate a large block
of memory and pick two addresses randomly. On a machine with 16 DRAM banks, this
gives us a 1/16 chance that the chosen addresses are in the same bank, which is
quite high.  We also can hammer the two rows of neighbors; this is called
&lt;strong&gt;double-sided hammering&lt;/strong&gt;, and this technique increases a lot the chances of
getting bit flips. It requires the attacker to know or guess what the offset
between the rows that are in the same bank and adjacent will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disturbances-on-dram&#34;&gt;Disturbances on DRAM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, &lt;strong&gt;disturbance errors&lt;/strong&gt; happen when there is an interaction between
two circuit components like capacitors, transistors, and wires that aren&amp;rsquo;t
isolated enough from each other. Depending on the interaction, many different
types of disturbances are possible. The result of these disturbances is two
kinds of errors: the &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; error. The &amp;ldquo;direction&amp;rdquo;
of these errors will depend on the &lt;strong&gt;orientation&lt;/strong&gt; of the cell (&lt;em&gt;CF DRAM
Structure &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, when a row&amp;rsquo;s voltage is switched on and off repeatedly (typically when we
access data and write it in the row buffer), some cells in nearby rows leak
their charge much faster. These cells cannot keep the charge for the time
interval at which they are refreshed (this time interval is the &lt;strong&gt;retention
time&lt;/strong&gt;). This retention time is usually 64ms. Three main reasons for these
disturbances have been found at the electronic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the &lt;strong&gt;electromagnetic coupling&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the result of
Alternative Current flowing through conductors. It induces an electromagnetic
field that constantly expands and contracts in reason of the AC&amp;rsquo;s nature.
Whenever electromagnetic lines of force cut through another conductor, a voltage
is induced in that conductor. This can lead to hazardous voltage in nearby
cells.  There are also &lt;strong&gt;bridges&lt;/strong&gt; which are unwanted connections between two
nodes in the memory. It is the result of the isolation layer in between cells
not being crafted properly, leaving a small conductive space. This leads to a
lack of isolation and increases the risk of disturbances errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is the &lt;strong&gt;hot carrier injections&lt;/strong&gt;: toggling a wordline for hundreds
of hours can damage it. As an example, a capacitor damaged with hot carrier
injections can leak its charge faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the miniaturization of the components, it becomes harder to keep
well-isolated DRAM capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-to-disturbances&#34;&gt;Solutions to disturbances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this problem, researchers from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://safari.ethz.ch/&#34;&gt;SAFARI&amp;rsquo;s research
group&lt;/a&gt; thought about several solutions. The main
difficulty is that the most simple solutions are very greedy, either in
performance or energy. Two viable solutions are finally discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;increasing-the-refresh-rate&#34;&gt;Increasing the refresh rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that a cell can leak its charge in a shorter time than the normal
retention time is the reason for disturbances.
Reducing the refresh interval could be a solution. Even if the cells lose the
charge, they will be refreshed before a disturbance occurs. The drawback of this
technique is that it would &lt;strong&gt;consume&lt;/strong&gt; a lot of energy but also significantly
reduce the &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt; of the module. Kim et al. found that to counteract
RowHammer, a refresh period of 8.2ms instead of the original 64ms would be
efficient. DRAM modules would then spend much more time refreshing their cells
(from 11% to 35% instead of 1% to 4%). These are the main reasons why this can&amp;rsquo;t
be a viable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ecc-module&#34;&gt;ECC module&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECC modules (Error Correcting Code Memory)
might be a solution. These memory chips have a built-in controller that includes
a parity code known as a &lt;strong&gt;Hamming Code&lt;/strong&gt;. If one of the bits flips, it can
detect it and report the correct data back to the host computer. This works by
employing an algorithm that relies on parity checks with the help of a few
redundancy bits. However, even such modules cannot correct multi-bit disturbance
errors because the Hamming codes aren&amp;rsquo;t effective in situations where error
rates are very high. Due to their &lt;strong&gt;expensive cost&lt;/strong&gt;, ECC modules are rarely
seen in the lambda consumer systems even though they are common in servers, for
example. This solution is interesting but too expensive to be accessible to
everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;retire-cells&#34;&gt;Retire cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim cells could also be &lt;strong&gt;detected and remapped&lt;/strong&gt; or even disabled.
This can be realized by the manufacturer or the user. The problem for the
manufacturer is that detecting it would take a big amount of time
(several days at least). Remapping it would not always be a good idea because
the DRAM might not have enough space. A user could use system-level techniques
to remap and detect faulty cells. On the other hand, the &lt;strong&gt;efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; of a
remapped or disabled bank/group of rows would be seriously &lt;strong&gt;tainted&lt;/strong&gt; by this
long process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refresh-neighbors&#34;&gt;Refresh neighbors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea could be
identifying sensitive cells (some cells are more sensitive than others) and
refreshing their neighbors. The difficulty is mainly about detecting the faulty
rows &lt;strong&gt;efficiently without using a lot of resources&lt;/strong&gt;. Some algorithms based on
&lt;strong&gt;hash functions&lt;/strong&gt; have been selected by the researchers: Bloom Filter and
Morris Counters. Here another limitation appears: hash functions rely on &lt;strong&gt;hash
collisions&lt;/strong&gt;. In particular situations, it can lead to tagging a large number of
healthy rows as sensitive and trigger many useless refreshes and &lt;strong&gt;consume
energy and performances&lt;/strong&gt;. So again, it seems that it is very difficult to find
protection without drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;para&#34;&gt;PARA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers dig out a method called PARA for &lt;em&gt;probabilistic adjacent
row activation&lt;/em&gt;. The concept is quite simple. As a row is accessed, there is
a little chance that the &lt;strong&gt;neighbor row shall be opened too&lt;/strong&gt;.
If a neighbor is opened, it is also  refreshed by extension. The principle of
the RowHammer attacks is hammering, meaning that a lot of accesses are done
in a short amount of time. The more the rows are opened, the more the
probability that a neighbor is opened is high. What makes this technique
interesting is that its impact is very small in a normal situation.
It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t require additional heavy hardware like ECC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is a &lt;strong&gt;probabilistic solution&lt;/strong&gt;, it might not prevent the totality of
the errors. It can still significantly lower the probability that a disturbance
error occurs.  Kim and his team think of implementing it in the memory
controller directly. An important piece of information the memory controller
needs is which rows are physically adjacent. Without it, it is difficult
to set up PARA. As a response, the researchers ask the manufacturer to
&lt;strong&gt;reveal the mapping function&lt;/strong&gt; for the rows. It is possible to store
it in a small ROM(Read Only Memory) of the DRAM, which already exists.
Nine years after the publication of this paper, some manufacturers implemented
this solution, and the probability of refresh can even be chosen in some bios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockhammer&#34;&gt;BlockHammer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a new solution was introduced by A. Giray Yaglikci et al.: BlockHammer.
They chose to prevent RowHammer by blacklisting the rapidly-accessed DRAM rows.
The two key challenges that this technique is trying to solve are :
- The &lt;strong&gt;scalability&lt;/strong&gt; as the vulnerability has worsened with the DDR4 and
new       LPDDR4; the solution must use an acceptable amount of performance
and energy.
- The &lt;strong&gt;compatibility&lt;/strong&gt; with new DRAM chips: they don&amp;rsquo;t want to modify the
internals of the chips, but the concept must work with any kind of DRAM,
and vendors choose to keep confidential the address mapping of their product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is to &lt;strong&gt;deactivate rows&lt;/strong&gt; which are toggled suspiciously. They
detect and blacklist rows that are a lot activated with a &lt;strong&gt;Bloom Filter&lt;/strong&gt;. If
the rate of activations is too high, the program blocks the access of the row at
the level of the &lt;strong&gt;memory scheduler&lt;/strong&gt;. Some tests have been run, and the team
demonstrated that this solution consumes a negligible quantity of energy and
performance in a situation without attack. In a RowHammer attack situation,
BlockHammer provides significantly higher performance (71% on average) and lower
energy consumption (32% on average) than the actual solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-80-words&#34;&gt;Conclusion (80 words)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduced the vulnerability RowHammer and briefly described the key points
of its history. We detailed and explained the phenomenon of disturbance error
and dived into DRAM structure and functioning. This article also covers the
procedure of RowHammer and why it works. Finally, some solutions are discussed,
and two of them stand out of the crowd: PARA and BlockHammer. Even though some
ingenious solutions have been found, modern DRAM chips aren&amp;rsquo;t completely
protected, and there is still some research to do.&lt;/p&gt;
